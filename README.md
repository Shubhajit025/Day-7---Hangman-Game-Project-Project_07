# Day-7---Hangman-Game-Project-Project_07
The Hangman Project is a word-guessing game where players try to guess a randomly chosen word one letter at a time to win the Game if He didn't Guess all the letter in the given 6 lifes He Lost the Game. This project incorporates all the Python skills learned so far, including loops, functions, conditionals, and string manipulation.
**How It Works**
* The program randomly selects a word from a predefined word list.
* A list containing underscores (_) representing the unguessed letters Another list is created containing the actual characters of the chosen word
* The player inputs a letter to guess.
* If the letter is correct, it replaces the corresponding underscore in the displayed w ord.If the letter is incorrect, the player loses a life.
* The game continues until The player correctly guesses all letters (Wins the game 🎉). if The player loses all six lives (Game over).
**Code Highlights**
* Learned how to use for loop inside the while loop and update the data while keeping the previously updated data as it is.
* Tracks player progress and updates the displayed word in real-time.
* Includes a lives left counter to limit incorrect guesses.
This project was a great challenge and helped reinforce my Python fundamentals!
